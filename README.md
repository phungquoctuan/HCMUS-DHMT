### Computer Graphics Course Repository  

This repository contains all the resources, assignments, and projects developed for the **Computer Graphics** course at the University of Science (VNU-HCM). The course covers fundamental and advanced concepts in computer graphics, focusing on rendering techniques, 3D modeling, and interactive visualizations.  

#### Contents:  
- **Lecture Notes & Tutorials**: Summarized topics, including transformations, lighting models, and rendering techniques.  
- **Assignments**: Practical exercises that apply theoretical knowledge in coding environments like OpenGL or WebGL.  
- **Projects**: Group and individual projects, such as 3D object rendering, shading, and interactive applications.  
- **Code Samples**: Example implementations of algorithms, including BÃ©zier curves, rasterization, and basic game engines.  
- **References**: Links to additional study materials, research papers, and useful tools.  

#### Highlights:  
- Focus on modern rendering pipelines.  
- Implementations of Phong, Blinn-Phong, and PBR lighting models.  
- Hands-on experience with 3D object manipulation and animation.
